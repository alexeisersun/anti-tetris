# Motivation

The idea behind this project has appeared when I was explaining how Bootstrap's grid system works on a concrete example.

That's why I've turned by 180 degrees the Tetris game, eliminated the _clear-row_ feature of a regular Tetris game and added different float elements. 

This will be a good visual exercise on how Bootstrap's grid system work.

# Installing

This project contains the HTML5 code which can be simply run in the browser either locally or on a server.

Just download the latest version of the project, open `index.html` and enjoy the game.

# Controls

`up-arrow` -> move the block upper;

`left-arrow` -> move the block to the left;

`right-arrow` -> move the block to the right;

# Bugs and future development

The short list of known bugs:
	* The game suddenly stops whilst the score keeps updating;

I'd be thankful if you tell me about the bugs you found.

In the future I'm planning to make it more stylish and with more game features e.g. custom bonuses and in-game sound.
